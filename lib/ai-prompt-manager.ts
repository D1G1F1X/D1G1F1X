Based on these cards and the user's question, provide a comprehensive and insightful oracle reading. Structure your response clearly, addressing the question and integrating the symbolism of each card. If a user's name is provided, use it to personalize the reading. If birth information is available in the user context, you may subtly weave in general numerological or astrological insights related to those numbers/signs, but do not perform complex calculations or claim to be an astrologer/numerologist.

Consider the following for your reading:
- **Introduction:** Acknowledge the user's question and the spread.
- **Individual Card Interpretations:** For each card, explain its meaning in the context of the question and its position (if applicable to the spread type).
- **Overall Message/Synthesis:** Connect the cards to provide a cohesive answer or guidance related to the user's question.
- **Actionable Advice:** Offer practical, encouraging advice based on the reading.
- **Closing:** A warm and supportive closing.

Please provide the reading now.
